Description: >
    FLASH (Fast Length Adjustment of SHort reads) is a very fast and accurate software tool to merge paired-end reads from NGS data.
---

The FLASh module parses the log messages generated by the [FLASh](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/FLASH/) read merger.  To create a log file, you can use `tee`.  From the FLASh help:

```bash
flash reads_1.fq reads_2.fq 2>&1 | tee logfilename.log
```

The sample name is set by the first input filename listed in the log.  However, this can be changed to using the first output filename (i.e. if you used FLASh's `--output-prefix=PREFIX` option) by using the following config:

```yaml
flash:
	use_output_name: true
```

The module can also parse the `.hist` numeric histograms output by FLASh.  Since the histogram's file format and extension are rather generic, this parsing only occurs if the `hist` user config option is set to avoid accidentally parsing a file output by another tool.  To set this option, use the following:

```yaml
flash:
	hist: true
```
